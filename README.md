# CNN-Cats-and-Dogs
This is basically my previous CNN network with the Kaggle dataset. I have transformed the Dataset, using Opencv. I have used Gaussian Blur, and Canny to process my data. Then I transformed them into a pickle. Because github wont allow file sizes over 100 mb, I had to upload a zipped version of my pickle.
